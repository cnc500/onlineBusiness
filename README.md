## Description

This e-commerce back-end application is a tool to help the user manage an online business through connecting to a SQL database using Sequelize. The database is seeded with test data. Using a command from the command line prompt, the server is started, and the models are synced so that the user can retrieve, add, modify or delete items from the database. These items include categories, products and product tags, all very necessary items for the online business manager to keep track of.
